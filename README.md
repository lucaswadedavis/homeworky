# Homeworky

A few weeks ago a friend, while enumerating the failings of React, mentioned offhandedly that you could make a fine framework just using d3 (which weâ€™d been using for data visualization inside a React app - the cause of his consternation).

So I decided to take up the challenge.

This little demonstration shows how one could use d3 as the backbone (haha) of an application without any other frameworks involved. React it is not, but it gets the job done.
